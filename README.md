# Hi there, I'm Neway Yifru! 👋

👨‍🎓 I'm a graduate student currently pursuing my master's degree in Sustainable Transportation and Electrical Power Systems (STEPS) through the Erasmus Mundus program.

🔍 My interests lie in the fascinating world of control systems, where I explore topics like Model Predictive Control (MPC), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and various Optimization Techniques, including Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

🤖 I'm passionate about applying my knowledge to practical applications. I'm always excited to collaborate on projects related to Electric Vehicles (EV), robotics, drones, and designing control systems for dynamic systems.
